# TypeSafety for Productivity

Slides for a 1 hour [presentation on how typesafety can improve developer productivity](https://sch3lp.github.io/typesafety-for-productivity-slides).

The [code](code) directory contains code for examples that are used during the presentation.

I used [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
